career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Motivated and driven DevOps Engineer with an M.Sc. in computer science and over
      5 years of professional experience working in projects from small to complex.
      Working in a fast-growing startup, where I am tasked with managing and developing
      the infrastructure for developers as well as the internal tooling.

      For the last 2-3 years I was actively leading a team of developers, by checking their
      capacity ratios and helping them to grow both with external and internal courses.
      This also included myself, where I could gather experiences with both AWS and Azure.

education:
    - degree: "Computer Science</br>Master of Science (M.Sc.)"
      university: Technical University of Munich
      time: 2015 - 2017

    - degree: "Informatics: Games Engineering</br>Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.)"
      university: Technical University of Munich
      time: 2011 - 2014

experiences:
    - role: Head of DevOps &amp; Infrastructure
      time: 2020 - now
      company: Motius GmbH, Munich
      details: |
        With the team now consisting of five developers and me informally leading them,
        the decision was made to appoint me as their supervisor. In close cooperation with our
        CTO I designed and structured an approach on transitioning towards Kubernetes. With the company
        growing rapidly I saw the need for internal training for our new developers, to bring
        them up to speed with both Kubernetes and the basic DevOps mindest.

        At the moment my team and I are maintaining a small 15 node cluster on bare-metal servers
        hosted with Hetzner. This cluster is used for internal tooling such as the integrated business
        platform as well as the delivery for our client projects.

          - Trainings for colleagues

    - role: DevOps Engineer
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: Motius GmbH, Munich
      details: |
        With the company growing the need arose for a more structured DevOps approach, which to me
        was a great opportunity to apply the experience that I gathered in the past and broaden my
        knowledge in a newly rising field. During this time I have also been named the interims
        lead for this section of the company.

          - Docker &amp; Docker-Compose
          - Python
          - CI/CD (Gitlab, Jenkins)

    - role: Project Owner
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: Motius GmbH, Garching
      details: |
        After the first successful projects and multiple university projects related to project management,
        the logical next step was to apply my theoretical knowledge to real projects. The company used a
        very modified variant of the scrum model for software &amp; hardware projects.

    - role: Junior Software Engineer
      time: 2017 - 2018
      company: Motius GmbH, Garching
      details: |
        For this project, we developed a retrofit device to enable washing machines to be connected and
        controlled using an App. In this project, I was using existing off-the-shelf hardware components
        intending to create a robust proof of concept.
