experiences:
    - role: Head of DevOps &amp; Infrastructure
      time: 2020 - now
      company: Motius GmbH, Munich
      details: |
        With the team now consisting of five developers the decission was taken to
        formally appoint me as their supervisor. The promotion also gave me the option to
        design a structured approach and transition towards Kubernetes with out CTO.
        With the company growing rapidly I saw the need for internal trainings for our
        new developers, to bring them up to speed with both Kubernetes as well as a basic
        DevOps mindest.

        At the moment my team and me are maintaining a small 15 node cluster on baremetal
        servers hosted with Hetzner. This cluster is both used for our platform, internal
        tooling and our client projects.

          - Kubernetes &amp; Helm
          - Trainings for colleagues

    - role: DevOps Engineer
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: Motius GmbH, Munich
      details: |
        With the company growing the need arose for a more structured DevOps approach,
        which to me was a great opportunity to apply the experience that I gathered
        in the past and broaden my knowledge in a new rising field. During this time
        I was also named the interims lead for this section of the company.

          - Docker &amp; Docker-Compose
          - Python
          - CI/CD (Gitlab, Jenkins)

    - role: Project Owner
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: Motius GmbH, Garching
      details: |
        After the first successful projects and multiple univerity projects related
        to project managment, for me the logical next step was to apply my theoretical
        knowledge to real projects. The company used a very modified variant of the
        scrum model for software &amp; hardware projects.

    - role: Junior Software Engineer
      time: 2017 - 2018
      company: Motius GmbH, Garching
      details: |
        For this project we developed a retrofit device to enable washing machines
        to be connected and controlled using an App. In this project I was using
        existing off-the-shelf hardware components with the goal to create a robust
        proof of concept.
